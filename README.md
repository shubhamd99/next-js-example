#### Next JS - A React Framework

* Next.js is an open-source React front-end development web framework created by Vercel (formerly Zeit) that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.

* Unlike a traditional React app where the entire application is loaded and rendered on the client, Next.js allows the first page to be rendered by the server, which is a great for SEO & perfromance.

###### Benefits
1. Easy page routing (No need of react router dom)
2. API Routes
3. Out of the box Typescript& Sass
4. Static site generation (next export)
5. Easy deployment
